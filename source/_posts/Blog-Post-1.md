#Problem Solving & Being Lazy

##Software Engineering

Software engineering is perceived by many to be a hard task;
it looks a bit like magic performed by some really clever 
boffins who get paid a lot. But really, all you need is
two key skills:

1. Problem Solving
2. The ability to be lazy

One of these comes easily to us, the other not so much. 

##Problem Solving

This is the easy one - it's human nature to boil things 
down to their basics. Every time you do a task (even the
simplest of tasks) you break down into smaller problems.

Let's take a look at some examples: making a jam sandwich:

-You need to make sure you have the required ingredients
-You need to get the ingredients:
   +Jam
   +Bread
   +Butter?
   
   And make sure you have enough of them.
-You also need to make sure that you have the equipment:
   +Plates
   +Knives

If you don't have these, you cannot continue. If you do,
then you can continue:

-Butter The bread
-Put jam on the bread
-Cut the bread
-Etcetera

I won't go on, because you could go on braking it down
into more, smaller pieces, but you get the idea. You
problem solve in everyday life, even if you don't
realise it.

Therefore, it is an eas skill to apply to software engineering.

##Being Lazy

This is the hard skill to learn. It is __not__ human nature to 
be lazy. But it is an important part of software engineering:
why write code if there is already stuff out there?

But I'm lazy, so I won't go on. I'll just give you this link:
